*Fliki is a fast, secure, and scalable Live TV Streaming Platform application built on React (Vite) and deployed through Cloudflare Pages & Workers. It uses Cloudflare D1 as its database layer and includes a complete admin dashboard for link and system management.*

*One of the biggest advantages of this project is that it runs entirely on Cloudflare’s free tier. <font color="green">Both Cloudflare Pages and D1 Database offer generous lifetime free usage</font>, making this solution extremely cost-effective for personal projects, startups, and production-ready deployments without any hosting expenses.*
